## Tech Debt Summary

Tech debt accumulated from earlier phases (v1.0):

### Phase 2: Core Migration
- **Type safety issue:** background.ts line 124 has a type spread that creates possibly undefined property. Build succeeds but `tsc --noEmit` fails. Non-blocking.

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality
- **Human verification needed:** Navigation interception in production requires Zendesk agent access.
- **Lifecycle testing needed:** Service worker persistence across browser sessions.

### Phase 5: Web Store Compliance
- **Documentation URL mismatch:** STORE-METADATA.md privacy policy URL points to zendesklabs/QuickTab instead of justcarlson/QuickTab.

### Phase 7: Version Sync
- **Post-release cleanup:** last-release-sha should be removed from release-please-config.json after next successful release PR merges (expected behavior per release-please docs).

### Phase 8: Chrome Web Store
- **Missing verification file:** No 08-VERIFICATION.md file (SUMMARYs document completion but pattern differs from earlier phases).

**Total:** 6 tech debt items across 5 phases (none blocking)

## Success Criteria from ROADMAP.md

### Phase 7: Version Sync

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| 1. package.json shows version "1.0.1" | ✓ MET |

| 3. Release-please manifest updated to track 1.0.1 | ✓ MET |
| 4. CI passes with correct version in artifacts | ✓ MET (verified on push) |

### Phase 8: Chrome Web Store
