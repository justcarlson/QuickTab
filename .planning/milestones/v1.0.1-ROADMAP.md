## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Set version to 1.0.1 (patch increment from v1.0)
- Use last-release-sha to scope release-please changelog to post-v1.0 commits
- Category: Workflow & Planning (fits support agent workflow optimization)
- Privacy policy hosted at raw GitHub URL (verified accessible)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Version mismatch between package.json (0.12.3) and GitHub release (v1.0)
- Extension not publicly available (now on Chrome Web Store)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- last-release-sha should be removed from release-please-config.json after next release PR merges
- No 08-VERIFICATION.md file (SUMMARYs document completion but pattern differs from earlier phases)
