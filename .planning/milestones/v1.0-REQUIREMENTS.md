# Requirements: QuickTab Modernization

**Defined:** 2026-01-25
**Core Value:** Zendesk links open in existing agent tabs, not new ones. This single behavior must work reliably.

## v1 Requirements

Requirements for modernization release. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Build System

- [x] **BUILD-02**: TypeScript 5.9+ with ES2022 target and strict mode enabled
- [x] **BUILD-03**: Source maps generated for development debugging
- [x] **BUILD-04**: npm scripts for dev, build, test, and lint workflows
- [x] **BUILD-05**: Hot module replacement (HMR) works during development
- [x] **BUILD-06**: Bundle size analysis available via build script

### Code Quality

- [x] **QUAL-01**: Biome configured for linting and formatting
- [x] **QUAL-02**: Pre-commit hooks enforce lint and format via Husky + lint-staged
- [x] **QUAL-03**: @types/chrome provides TypeScript definitions for Chrome APIs
- [x] **QUAL-04**: CI runs Biome checks on pull requests

### Testing

- [x] **TEST-01**: Vitest configured for unit testing
- [x] **TEST-02**: Chrome API mocking via @webext-core/fake-browser
- [x] **TEST-03**: Unit tests cover URL matching logic
- [x] **TEST-04**: Unit tests cover storage operations
- [x] **TEST-05**: Unit tests cover service worker event handlers
- [x] **TEST-06**: E2E tests with Playwright for navigation flows
- [x] **TEST-07**: Coverage reporting integrated with test runs
- [x] **TEST-08**: Service worker termination tests validate state persistence

### CI/CD

- [x] **CICD-01**: GitHub Actions workflow runs lint, test, build on PR
- [x] **CICD-02**: GitHub Actions workflow runs on push to main
- [x] **CICD-03**: Automated version bumping on release
- [x] **CICD-04**: Changelog generated from conventional commits
- [x] **CICD-05**: Release workflow creates ZIP artifact on tag

### Web Store Compliance

- [x] **STORE-01**: Privacy policy document created and linked
- [x] **STORE-02**: Permission audit completed — unused permissions removed
- [x] **STORE-03**: All dependencies bundled — no remote code execution
- [x] **STORE-04**: Code is minified but not obfuscated
- [x] **STORE-05**: Store metadata updated (description, screenshots)

### Git Workflow

- [x] **GIT-01**: Each phase developed on dedicated feature branch
- [x] **GIT-02**: Git worktrees used for parallel development and safe rollback
- [x] **GIT-03**: Atomic commits per logical change with conventional commit messages
- [x] **GIT-04**: PRs required for merging to main — no direct commits
- [x] **GIT-05**: Main branch always deployable — broken code never merged
- [x] **GIT-06**: Tags mark each phase completion for easy revert points

### Code Migration
