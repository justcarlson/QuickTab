<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create Store Listing Content</name>
  <files>docs/STORE-LISTING.md</files>
  <action>
Create docs/STORE-LISTING.md with complete Chrome Web Store listing content.

Structure the document with copy-paste sections for each dashboard field:

**Title:** "Zendesk Quicktab" (from messages.json)

**Summary (132 char max):**
"For Zendesk agents: stop tab chaos. Links open in your existing agent tab, not a new one. Fewer tabs, faster workflow."

**Description:** Follow the structure from 08-RESEARCH.md:
1. Opening hook stating core value
2. Target audience (Zendesk support agents)
3. Feature list (3 bullets: existing tab routing, tab reduction, works with all /agent URLs)
4. How it works (brief explanation)
5. Call-to-action for feedback (GitHub issues)

**Category:** Productivity

**Language:** English

**Permission Justifications:** Include a section with copy-paste text for each permission:
- webNavigation: Detects navigation to Zendesk ticket URLs for redirection
- tabs: Queries and focuses existing Zendesk agent tabs
- storage: Saves URL detection preference locally
- scripting: Sends navigation messages to Zendesk's SPA
- host_permissions (*.zendesk.com): Limits operation to Zendesk domains only

**URLs:**
- Privacy Policy: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justcarlson/QuickTab/master/PRIVACY.md
- Support: https://github.com/justcarlson/QuickTab/issues

Tone: Professional, minimal, factual. No keyword stuffing.

1. Run clean build: `npm run build` (or pnpm if available)
2. Verify output exists: `.output/quicktab-v1.0.1-chrome.zip`
3. List contents of zip to verify structure:
   - manifest.json present
   - background script present
   - popup files present
   - icons present (including 128x128)
4. Verify manifest.json has correct version (1.0.1)
5. Test privacy policy URL is accessible:
   `curl -sI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justcarlson/QuickTab/master/PRIVACY.md | head -1`
   Should return HTTP 200

If privacy policy URL fails (404), note this as a blocker for Plan 02.
