<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Monitor Review and Handle Feedback</name>
  <what-built>Extension submission to Chrome Web Store</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Check Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard for review status
2. Review typically completes within 24 hours (up to 3 days with host permissions)

**If APPROVED:**
- Extension will appear in Chrome Web Store
- Test installation: Search "Zendesk Quicktab" or use direct link
- Verify extension installs and popup displays correctly

**If REJECTED:**
- Read rejection reason carefully (check email from Chrome Web Store team)
- Common issues and fixes:
  - "Purple Potassium" (permission issues) -> Review permission justifications
  - "Purple Lithium" (privacy policy) -> Check URL accessibility
  - Missing information -> Complete required fields
- Make necessary fixes and resubmit

**Review status locations:**
- Dashboard: Shows "Pending review", "Published", or "Rejected"
- Email: Google sends notifications to developer email
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type one of:
- "published" + Chrome Web Store URL if extension is live
- "rejected: [reason]" if rejected (we'll create a gap closure plan)
- "pending" if still in review (we'll wait and check again)
