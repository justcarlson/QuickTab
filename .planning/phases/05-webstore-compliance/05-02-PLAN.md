<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update README with Permissions section</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
Expand the existing Permissions section in README.md. Currently it just says:
"QuickTab requests permission to read and change data on `zendesk.com` so it can detect and redirect `/agent` links."

Replace with detailed Permissions section explaining each permission:

```markdown
## Permissions

QuickTab requests minimal permissions to function:

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|------------|----------------|
| **zendesk.com access** | To detect Zendesk `/agent` navigation and route to existing tabs |
| **Tab access** | To find your existing Zendesk tabs and focus them when routing |
| **Storage** | To save your detection mode preference between browser sessions |
| **Web navigation** | To intercept link clicks before they open new tabs |

### What We Don't Request

- No access to other websites
- No access to your browsing history
- No access to read page content
- No access to cookies or passwords

For complete details, see our [Privacy Policy](PRIVACY.md).
```

Keep all other README sections unchanged. Insert the expanded Permissions section in place of the existing one-liner.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -A 15 "## Permissions" README.md</verify>
  <done>README.md Permissions section has table format, explains 4 permissions, includes "What We Don't Request" subsection, links to PRIVACY.md</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create store metadata document</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/05-webstore-compliance/STORE-METADATA.md</files>
  <action>
Create STORE-METADATA.md to capture Chrome Web Store listing content. This document serves as the reference for submission:

```markdown
# Chrome Web Store Metadata

**Last updated:** [today's date]
**Status:** Ready for submission

## Store Description

### Short Description (132 char max)
Routes Zendesk links to existing agent tabs. No more tab clutter.

### Detailed Description

Tired of duplicate Zendesk tabs?

QuickTab keeps your workspace tidy. When you click a Zendesk /agent link from anywhere — Slack, email, docs — QuickTab routes it to your existing Zendesk tab instead of opening a new one.

**Features:**
- One focused Zendesk tab instead of tab clutter
- Works with links from any app or website
- Toggle on/off with one click
- Ticket-only mode for targeted routing
- Zero setup, zero accounts, zero data collection

**Privacy:**
QuickTab runs entirely in your browser. No data is sent anywhere. No analytics. No tracking. See our privacy policy for details.

**Open Source:**
QuickTab is open source. View the code at github.com/zendesklabs/QuickTab
